###### Pushing your features to your fork
Clone the repository on your local machine and push features from a git client [reccomended]<br>
I highly advise GitKraken as a git client (Easy to use and intuitive)<br>

If you want to contribute adding code comments or either you want to add comments to explain your features do it by adding line/block comments *above* the line you want to explain.<br>
Example:
```java
//Example integer variable
int exampleVar
```

**Please pay attention on where you upload your features** <br>
you should know how a mod is structured<br>
Source code directory: `src/main/java`<br>
Resources directory: `src/main/resources`<br><br>

**Refer to the model/blockstate directory for texture organization and naming conventions** <br>
Models directory: `src/main/resources/assets/m5/models` <br>
Blockstates directory: `src/main/resources/assets/m5/blockstates` <br>

###### Creating the Pull request
Things TO DO!<br>
**BEFORE creating the pull request check if your changes break anything and if your PR has any bugs**<br>
Tell us about the changes and how they are implemented in the pull request description<br>
If you pushed commit to one branch you need to pull request to that same branch!<br>
Compare across forks!<br>
Check in the commit section below if the commits you are proposing are yours

###### Pull request discussion
Remember to always keep an eye on the pull request discussion, because we might ask you to change something in the files or ask you something about the pull request content
