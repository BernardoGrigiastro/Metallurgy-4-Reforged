###### Pushing your features to your fork
There are 2 ways to do it:

1. Add files directly from github (Beware to choose the right branch! and directory! see below)<br>

2. Clone the repository on your local machine and push features from a git client [reccomended]<br>
I highly advise GitKraken as a git client (Easy to use and intuitive)<br>

Please pay attention on where you upload your features<br>
you should know how a mod is structured<br>
Source code directory: src/main/java<br>
Resources directory: src/main/resources<br><br>

**Refer to the model/blockstate directory for texture organization and naming conventions** <br>
Models directory: src/main/resources/assets/m5/models <br>
Blockstates directory: src/main/resources/assets/m5/blockstates <br>

If you plan on contribuing multiple times or continuously I suggest you the second method of committing features to your fork
