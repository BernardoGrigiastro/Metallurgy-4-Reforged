This mod is a collaboration between: Me and ItHurtsLikeHell

Metallurgy 4: Reforged is a mod that implements a lot of different materials some realistic ones and some fantasy ones, and alloys too
It's a fully customizable mod, and it also has some special effects for armors and tools made with these materials
Further integration with common mods (like Tinkers' Construct) is not currently avaliable but planned too
