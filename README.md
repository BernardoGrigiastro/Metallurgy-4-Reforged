# Metallurgy-5
This is Metallurgy 5 an unofficial port of Metallurgy 4 by JeanGlassMaker & ShadowClaimer

This mod is a collaboration between: Me and ItHurtsLikeHell

Metallurgy is a mod that implements a lot of different materials some realistic ones and some fantasy ones, and alloys too
It's a fully customizable mod, and it also has some special effects for armors and tools made with these materials
Further integration with common mods (like Tinkers' Construct ) is not currently avaliable but planned too

According to GNU General Public License v3 we are porting also official features
Textures will be different from the original one
